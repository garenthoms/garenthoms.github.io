**Part 2: Identifying the Exact Start and End of Long-Term Movements**

The second part of the system focuses on pinpointing the **exact start or end** of a long-term currency movement.

**Key Point:**

- We are still analyzing the **long-term movement** of a currency. Knowing exactly where a trend begins or ends gives us the confidence to stay in our trades, even during market noise or pullbacks.

**How to Identify the Start or End of a Trend:**

- **Secret 3:** The exact start or end of a long-term trend can only be identified on the **monthly chart** using **technical analysis**.

**Indicator: 3rd Level Semafor**

To filter out market noise and stay focused on the true trend, we use the **3rd Level Semafor** indicator. This tool helps to **minimize distractions** from short-term price movements and allows us to see when the market has reached a significant turning point.

**Visual Example: USD/JPY**

Take a look at the USD/JPY chart where we’ve marked the **Red & Blue Circles**. These circles highlight the start (red) and end (blue) of a long-term trend.

**Correction:**

- Where the chart says "enter," it should actually say start.
- Where it says "exit," it should say end.

**Why This is Important**

By knowing the exact start of a long-term trend, we gain the confidence to hold our positions—even when the market seems to be moving against us. The key here is to stay calm and avoid the urge to close trades prematurely.

**Pro Tip:**

Remember, institutional banks often need retail traders to move in the wrong direction to fill their trades. So, when the market appears chaotic, it’s just part of the process before the real trend resumes.
