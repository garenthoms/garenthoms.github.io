**Part 4: Money Management – The Key to Profitable Trading**

This section is perhaps the most critical of all. **If you master money management, you'll be consistently making money** in the market. Here, I’ll outline simple but powerful rules to guide you through the process.

---

**Rule 1: Set Your Goals**

Before you begin live trading, you must set realistic financial goals. Your goals will shape your trading style and decisions.

**Examples:**
- **Part-time income goal:** $123 per week.
- **Full-time income goal:** $246 per week.
- **Retirement goal:** Grow your account by 2.5% per month.

Your goals should be aligned with your financial situation and time commitment to ensure they are reasonable and achievable.

**Rule 2: Set a Pip Target Per Month**

You need to define how many pips you aim to collect each month.

Example:
- My goal was 1,000 pips per month, which breaks down to 250 pips per week.

With a weekly target in mind, you can ask yourself these three questions:

1. Can I make 50 pips in 5 trades this week?
2. Can I make 125 pips in 2 trades this week?
3. Can I make 250 pips in 1 trade this week?

Since I prefer to trade with minimal effort and free up time for other activities, I focus on **making all my pips in one trade**. This takes my mind off constantly thinking about money and instead focuses on collecting pips because **pips = money**.

**Rule 3: Set the Amount You're Willing to Lose**

You need to determine your risk tolerance. For me, this wasn't easy, but I set a goal to risk only **1% of my monthly income** on any single trade.

**Example:**

- When I was earning **$500,000 JMD** per month, I decided to risk **5,000 JMD** per trade.
- In USD, this equated to **$36** per trade, using the exchange rate at the time.

This amount was acceptable to me, considering I was already spending that much per week on non-essential activities like going to bars or playing poker.

---

**Risk Capital Calculation**

To start trading, I followed the basic rule of **only risking 2% of your total capital** on all live trades.

**Calculation:**

- If I was willing to lose $36 per trade, I needed $1,800 USD in capital (36 ÷ 2% = $1,800).

Now that I knew the capital I needed, I could work out the **lot size** per trade.

**Important:** If you don’t know what a pip or lot size is, pause here and do some research before proceeding.

---

**Rule 4: Start with $1,000 USD Capital**

If you don't have $1,000, save up until you do. In the meantime, practice on a **demo account**.

In any field, there’s a **probation period** in Forex, it’s not about time, but about the **number of trades**.

- The probation period in Forex trading is **100 trades**. After completing 100 trades, you’ll be ready to take on bigger risks.

**Lot Size Recommendation:**

- When trading with $1,000 in capital, I recommend trading with a lot **size of $0.10** per trade.
- If you have 10 trades open at the same time, each trade should be **$0.01 cents per lot**, not $1 per lot.

---

**Risk Management Example**

If the price moves against you:

- 10 pips = $1 loss
- 100 pips = $10 loss
- 1,000 pips = $100 loss
- 10,000 pips = $1,000 loss

If you lose 10,000 pips, Forex trading may not be the right path for you. It's better to view the loss as tuition for a course you didn’t pass and consider other business options.

---

**Success Measurement**

On the flip side, if you manage to gain 10,000 pips, you’ll have doubled your capital, which means you’re good enough to **trade like the big players**. At this point, you’ll be able to:

- **Increase your risk** while maintaining control.
- **Copy your trades** onto a larger account and manage them with ease, knowing you’ve mastered the system.

With a solid grasp of money management, you’ll be ready to approach trading like a **professional**.
