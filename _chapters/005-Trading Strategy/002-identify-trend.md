**Part 1: Identifying the Long-Term Fundamental Trend**

The first step in the system is to determine the **long-term fundamental trend** for any currency. This trend is crucial because it helps us understand when major movements began and ended.

**Key Point:**
- The long-term movement of a currency is often driven by **government policies**. Once you know what to look for, these trends become easy to spot.

**How to Identify the Long-Term Trend:**
- **Secret 1:** You can only find the long-term trend on the **monthly chart**, and we’ll use **technical analysis** to spot it.

**Technical Indicator:**
- We use a **2-period Moving Average (2MA)** set to **open** on the **monthly chart**. This gives us a clear visual of the trend.

**Example of Long-Term Trends in Major Currencies**

Let’s look at two major currency pairs and how their fundamental trends changed over time:

- **USD/JPY (2014-2022):**
    The fundamental trend changed direction **6 times** over 8 years.

- **GBP/USD (2014-2022):**
    The fundamental trend changed direction **7 times over** 8 years.

**Observation:**

In the examples, notice the **yellow line** on the charts, which represents the 2MA. This line helps us track the long-term trend.

**Part 2: Trading on Lower Time Frames**

Once we’ve identified the long-term trend, the next step is to **trade on a lower time frame**, specifically the **4-hour chart**.

**Mathematical Breakdown:**

To convert the 2MA on the monthly chart to lower time frames, we use basic math:

1. **Monthly to Weekly:**
  - 2MA (monthly) × 4 weeks = **8MA on the weekly chart**.
2. **Weekly to Daily:**
  - 8MA (weekly) × 5 days = **40MA on the daily chart**.
3. **Daily to 4-Hour:**
  - 40MA (daily) × 6 (4-hour candles per day) = **240MA on the 4-hour chart**.

**Example: USD/JPY**

Let’s apply this to the USD/JPY:
- From **2014 to 2022**, the USD/JPY experienced an 18-month run.
  
Now, we’ll look at the **weekly**, **daily**, and **4-hour charts** for further insights.

**Part 3: The Trading Rule**

The trading rule is simple and effective:
- **BUY** above the **240MA** line.
- **SELL below the **240MA** line.
  
This approach allows us to align with institutional investors, banks, and government actions while ignoring the noise that affects 99% of retail traders.

---

**Why This Strategy Works**

By following this system, we’re not trading based on news or speculation. Instead, we’re aligning with the movements of institutional banks and governments, which truly drive the forex market. Let retail traders chase news while we follow the smart money.
