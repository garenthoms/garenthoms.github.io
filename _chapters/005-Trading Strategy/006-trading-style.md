**Part 5: Discovering What Type of Trader You Want to Be**

The fifth part of the system is figuring out **what type of trader** you want to be. This is determined by your capital, the risk you’re willing to take, and how much time you can spend monitoring the market.

You might be asking: **How do I figure this out?**

---

**Step 1: Calculate Your Risk per Trade**

Let’s take an example of trading with $1,000 capital.

- You decide to risk **2% per trade**.
- This means your maximum risk is: $1,000 × 2% = **$20 USD**.

Next, let’s figure out how many pips you can afford to lose before you hit your $20 loss:

- **$20 ÷ $0.10 per lot = 200 pips**.

So, it would take a **200-pip move** against your position to lose $20.

---

**Step 2: Compare Your Target Pips to Your Goal**

Now, let’s say your monthly goal is to make **1,000 pips**.

If you’re aiming for 1,000 pips and trading at $0.10 per pip, your income for the month would be:

- **1,000 pips × $0.10 per pip = $100 USD per month**.

That’s about $25 USD per week.

---

**Step 3: Assess Your Goal**

Now, look at your goal. Let’s say you want to make a **full-time income of $246 per week**.

You’re missing your goal by **$221 per week**. What can you do? You have two options:

- Increase your capital to trade larger amounts.
- Increase the number of pips you earn per month.

For most new traders, increasing your capital is difficult, so the easiest route is to **aim for more pips**.

---

**Step 4: Leverage and Pips**

To achieve your full-time income goal of $246 per week, let’s calculate how many pips you need.

- **$246 ÷ $0.10 per pip = 2,460 pips** per week.

You would need to make 2,460 pips per week to hit your goal. But if you’re taking only one trade per week, that’s going to be tough.

---

**Step 5: Use Leverage the Right Way**

To reduce the number of pips required, you’ll need to **use leverage** wisely.

Let’s adjust your lot size while keeping your **maximum risk** at $20 per trade:

- **$20 ÷ 200 pips = 0.1 lot size**.
- **$20 ÷ 100 pips = 0.2 lot size**.
- **$20 ÷ 50 pips = 0.4 lot size**.
- **$20 ÷ 25 pips = 0.8 lot size**.

As you lower your stop loss, you’ll be able to increase your lot size. However, with a lower stop loss, you need to be more precise with your entries since you could hit your 2% loss quicker.

---

**Step 6: Calculate Your Weekly Pip Target**

Now, let’s calculate how many pips you’ll need each week to hit your full-time income goal at different lot sizes:

- **$246 ÷ $0.10 per pip = 2,460 pips**.
- **$246 ÷ $0.20 per pip = 1,230 pips**.
- **$246 ÷ $0.40 per pip = 615 pips**.
- **$246 ÷ $0.80 per pip = 308 pips**.

---

**Step 7: Pair Stop Loss with Lot Size**

Let’s combine your stop loss and lot size to manage your risk effectively:

- With a **200-pip stop loss**, trade with **0.1 lots**.
- With a **100-pip stop loss**, trade with **0.2 lots**.
- With a **50-pip stop loss**, trade with **0.4 lots**.
- With a **25-pip stop loss**, trade with **0.8 lots**.

**Conclusion: Crafting Your Trading Style**

By understanding these key elements your capital, stop loss, and lot size you can **customize your trading style** to suit your goals and lifestyle. Whether you want to make small, consistent gains or aim for larger, more aggressive profits, the system can be tailored to help you succeed.
